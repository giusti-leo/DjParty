# DjParty

Dj Party is a new frontier for music management at parties. 
It completely replaces the dj job by giving user the possibility to search and vote songs they would like to hear, and the Dj Party will play the music.
Now connect your device to the audio system, invite your friends and feel the vibes!

Dj Party is a **Mobile Application** interacting the music streaming provider **Spotify** through API and allowing the authentication with **Google** and **Facebook** services.
It employs a **Client-Server architecture**. The Client-side is developped in **Flutter** in order to be cross-platform and the Server-side is fully hosted in Google Firebase by using Cloud Firebase, a **NoSQL document database**, in order to simplify the storage and querying the data.
